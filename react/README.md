# Airbnb React/JSX Style Guide

*A mostly reasonable approach to React and JSX*

This style guide is mostly based on the standards that are currently prevalent in JavaScript, although some conventions (i.e async/await or static class fields) may still be included or prohibited on a case-by-case basis. Currently, anything prior to stage 3 is not included nor recommended in this guide.

## Basic Rules

  - Only include one React component per file.
    - However, multiple [Stateless, or Pure, Components](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html#stateless-functions) are allowed per file. eslint: [`react/no-multi-comp`](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/no-multi-comp.md#ignorestateless).
  - Always use JSX syntax.
  - Do not use `React.createElement` unless you’re initializing the app from a file that is not JSX.
  - [`react/forbid-prop-types`](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/forbid-prop-types.md) will allow `arrays` and `objects` only if it is explicitly noted what `array` and `object` contains, using `arrayOf`, `objectOf`, or `shape`.

## Naming

  - **Extensions**: Use `.jsx` extension for React components. eslint: [`react/jsx-filename-extension`](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/jsx-filename-extension.md)
  - **Filename**: Use PascalCase for filenames. E.g., `ReservationCard.jsx`.
  - **Reference Naming**: Use PascalCase for React components and camelCase for their instances. eslint: [`react/jsx-pascal-case`](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/jsx-pascal-case.md)

    ```jsx
    // bad
    import reservationCard from './ReservationCard';

    // good
    import ReservationCard from './ReservationCard';

    // bad
    const ReservationItem = <ReservationCard />;

    // good
    const reservationItem = <ReservationCard />;
    ```

  - **Component Naming**: Use the filename as the component name. For example, `ReservationCard.jsx` should have a reference name of `ReservationCard`. However, for root components of a directory, use `index.jsx` as the filename and use the directory name as the component name:

    ```jsx
    // bad
    import Footer from './Footer/Footer';

    // bad
    import Footer from './Footer/index';

    // good
    import Footer from './Footer';
    ```

  - **Props Naming**: Avoid using DOM component prop names for different purposes.

    > Why? People expect props like `style` and `className` to mean one specific thing. Varying this API for a subset of your app makes the code less readable and less maintainable, and may cause bugs.

    ```jsx
    // bad
    <MyComponent style="fancy" />

    // bad
    <MyComponent className="fancy" />

    // good
    <MyComponent variant="fancy" />
    ```
